       " Document(page_content=\"# MMDetection\\nWe have provided a default [Determined experiment configuration for Mask-RCNN on COCO 2017](./maskrcnn.yaml) as the starting point.\\n\\n## Configuring MMDetection\\nMMDetection has [its own configuration system](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/config.html) for specifying the dataset, model, optimizer, and other objects used during training.  Customizing MMDetection primarily amounts to specifying\\nyour own MMDetection configs and we preserve this when using MMDetection with Determined.  Hence, similar to directly using MMDetection, you will need to be familiar with MMDetection's configurable objects in order to get more custom behavior.\\n\\nWe will cover how to specify and manipulate a *MMDetection config* in the experiment configuration below.  \\n\\n### Specifying a predefined MMDetection config\\nThe easiest way to specify a MMDetection config is to use one of [the provided ones](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs).  The configs in this folder are already available in the docker image that we build for use with model-hub MMDetection at `/mmdetection/configs`.  You can specify a path to the MMDetection config by changing the `config_file` filed under `hyperparameters`. \\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```\\nhyperparameters:\\n  config_file: /mmdetection/configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rccn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py\\n```\\n\\nThis field is required and you can either use an existing config in the `/mmdetection/configs` directory of the `determinedai/model-hub-mmdetection` docker image or provide a path to your own MMDetection config in this experiment context.\\n\\n### Merging a config file\\nYou can also specify a file to merge into and override the values in the MMDetection config loaded from `hyperparameters.config_file`.  \\nThe format should be the same as that for MMDetection config files.  Suppose we saved a file called `merge_config.py` with\\nthe below lines to override the optimizer:\\n```python\\noptimizer = dict(                                                                                   \\n    type='AdamW',                                                                                   \\n    lr=0.0001,                                                                                      \\n    weight_decay=0.0001,                                                                            \\n)\\n```\\n\\nThen to apply it, you just need to modify the experiment config as follows:\\n\\n```\\nhyperparameters:\\n  merge_config: ./merge_config.py\\n```\\n\\n### Overriding config fields\\nFinally, if you only want to override a few fields of the MMDetection config, you can use the \\n`override_mmdet_config` section under `hyperparameters`.  The overrides here will be applied last \\nand hence take precedence over the values from a merged file if specified.\\nYou can indicate nested config structure by using a `.` to indicate a child of a field.  For example, \\nyou can add the following to `hyperparameters.override_mmdet_config` to change the learning rate:\\n\\n```\\nhyperparameters:\\n  override_mmdet_config:\\n    optimizer.lr: 0.005\\n```\\n\\nThere are provided examples commented out in the default config that show how to use the override\\nfield to turn on gradient clipping and mixed precision.  \\n\\n### Other experiment config fields\\n#### Data backends\\nWe support `s3`, and `gcs` backends in addition to the [file client backends supported by MMCV](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/mmcv/fileio/file_client.html#FileClient) so you can easily access data in cloud storage buckets.  Note that MMDetection expects the data to follow [a particular structure for standard datasets](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1_exist_data_model.html#test-existing-models-on-standard-datasets) like COCO, Pascal, Cityscapes.\\n\\nYou can change the backend by modifying the `data.file_client_args` section of the experiment config.\", metadata={'source': 'determined/model_hub/examples/mmdetection/README.md', 'url': 'https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/main/model_hub/examples/mmdetection/README.md'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='You can change the backend by modifying the `data.file_client_args` section of the experiment config.\\n\\n#### Batch sizes\\nThe `hyperparameters.global_batch_size` field of the Determined experiment config is required and must be filled in when submitting the experiment.  If you want it to match a given MMDetection config, you should set it to `data.samples_per_gpu * world_size`.\\n\\n#### Using pretrained weights\\nMMDetection provides pretrained checkpoints corresponding to some of the configurations as listed in the `README` files for each model type.  If a pretrained weight is available for the specified `config_file`, you can warmstart the model with these weights by setting `hyperparameters.use_pretrained` to `true`.  \\n\\n## Using custom dataset\\nTraining MMDetection on custom datasets in Determined is largely the same process as doing so directly with MMDetection.  Please follow [this guide](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/customize_dataset.html) from MMDetection to register your own datasets.\\n\\n## Adding classes\\nCreating custom classes for models, otpimizers, losses, and other MMDetection objects also requires following the same process as you would normally.  Please see the [MMDetection tutorials](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/customize_models.html) for more info.\\n\\n## Results\\nThe validation bounding box mAP for Faster-RCNN is shown in the image below.\\n\\n![Faster-RCNN mAP](fasterrcnn.png \"Faster-RCNN\")\\n\\n## To Run\\nIf you have not yet installed Determined, installation instructions can be found\\nunder `docs/install-admin.html` or at https://docs.determined.ai/latest/index.html\\n\\nMake sure the environment variable `DET_MASTER` is set to your cluster URL.\\nThen you run the following command from the command line: `det experiment create -f <experiment_config> .`. \\n\\nFor modular and composable configuration, please check out how to [use MMDetection with Facebook\\'s hydra](./hydra/README.md`).', metadata={'source': 'determined/model_hub/examples/mmdetection/README.md', 'url': 'https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/main/model_hub/examples/mmdetection/README.md'}),\n",

See the trial definition for more guidance on how to use custom data files.  \\n\\nTo run with multiple GPUs (whether single node or multiple nodes), change `slots_per_trial` to the desired\\ndegree of parallelism.

       " Document(page_content=\"# tools/scripts\\n\\nThis directory is the home for tools that directly assist in the development of\\nthe determined repository.\\n\\n## `bumpenvs`: How to bump task environment versions\\n\\nOur task environments are versioned separately from the main determined\\nrepository. The motivation for this is that customers who maintain custom\\nDocker images as extensions to our image should not have to rebuild their\\ncustom images as often as we cut releases. Since in practice our prebuilt\\nenvironments are pretty slow to change, and since some organizations have a\\nlong and tedious security review for task environments, this is a good thing\\nfor customers. But it does mean that updates to the environments repo have to\\nbe registered in the determined repo. Here is the process:\\n\\n1. Land the desired change in the environments repo. Remember the full commit\\n   hash (we'll call it `THECOMMIT` in these steps).\\n\\n   Note, you might as well include an update to the base AMIs if you're going\\n   to rebuild them.  From the `tools/scripts` directory of the determined repo,\\n   run:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   ./refresh-ubuntu-amis.py --packer-json /path/to/environments-packer.json\\n   ```\\n\\n1. Wait for the post-merge-to-master CircleCI jobs on the environments repo to\\n   finish. These will publish the relevant Docker/AWS/GCP images and create\\n   machine-readable artifacts containing the image tags.\\n\\n1. Enter the `tools/scripts` directory of the determined repo.\\n\\n1. Run `./update-bumpenvs-yaml.py bumpenvs.yaml THECOMMIT`. This will fetch the\\n   above-mentioned machine-readable artifacts from the CircleCI jobs of the\\n   environments repository, parse out the image tags, and update the relevant\\n   entries in `bumpenvs.yaml`.  For every artifact found, this will set that\\n   artifact's `old` value to the previous `new` value, and set the new `new`\\n   value to the artifact produced by CI, including the task environments and\\n   the agent AMIs.\\n\\n1. Run `./refresh-ubuntu-amis.py --bumpenvs-yaml bumpenvs.yaml`.  This will\\n   fetch the up-to-date Ubuntu AMIs for each region for each of the\\n   `*_master_ami` and `*_bastion_ami` image tags in bumpenvs.yaml.  This isn't\\n   strictly necessary; we just need to run it periodically, and now is a fine\\n   time.\\n\\n1. Run `./bumpenvs.py bumpenvs.yaml`.  This will do a simple string replacement\\n   in the repository, replacing the `old` values with the `new` values for\\n   every image type identified in `bumpenvs.yaml`.\\n\\n## `gen-attributions.py`: Automated OSS Compliance\\n\\nOSS License compliance is is important for being good OSS citizens and it is\\nvery important for some of our strategic partnerships.  There are several such\\ndocuments that we must maintain, and because golang binaries and the WebUI are\\neffectively statically linked, the maintenance effort is potentially very high.\\n\\nTherefore, to make life a little bit easier, we have a system for generating\\nthose license documents.  All you have to do is create specially formatted\\nlicense files for every external dependency of `determined-master`,\\n`determined-agent`, or the WebUI, and place them in the `licenses/` directory.\\n\\nThe format of the file is rfc822 format (the email format), which is a set of\\nheaders, followed by an empty line, followed by some preformatted text.  The\\nheaders contain metadata about the license and everything after the empty line\\nshould be the exact copy/pasted license text from the project in question.\\nHere is an example:\\n\\n```plain\\nName: github.com/lib/pq\\nType: mit\\nAgent: false\\nMaster: true\\nWebui: false\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2011-2013, 'pq' Contributors\\nPortions Copyright (C) 2011 Blake Mizerany\", metadata={'source': 'determined/tools/scripts/README.md', 'url': 'https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/main/tools/scripts/README.md'}),\n",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\\nFoundation\\'s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\\nyour programs, too.\\n\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\\n\\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.', metadata={'source': 'determined/tools/scripts/licenses/throttle-debounce', 'url': 'https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/main/tools/scripts/licenses/throttle-debounce'}),\n",

You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\\nrights.\\n\\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\\n\\n  Also, for each author\\'s protection and ours, we want to make certain\\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\\nauthors\\' reputations.\\n\\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\\npatent must be licensed for everyone\\'s free use or not licensed at all.\\n\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow.\\n\\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\\n\\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\\n\\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\\n\\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\\'s\\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\\nalong with the Program.\\n\\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\\n\\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\\n\\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\\n    parties under the terms of this License.', metadata={'source': 'determined/tools/scripts/licenses/throttle-debounce', 'url': 'https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/main/tools/scripts/licenses/throttle-debounce'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\\n\\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\\n\\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\\ncollective works based on the Program.\\n\\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\\nthe scope of this License.\\n\\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\\n\\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\\n\\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\\n\\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\\n\\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\\nitself accompanies the executable.\\n\\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.', metadata={'source': 'determined/tools/scripts/licenses/throttle-debounce', 'url': 'https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/main/tools/scripts/licenses/throttle-debounce'}),\n",

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\\nthe Program or works based on it.\\n\\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\\nthis License.\\n\\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\\n\\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\\nimpose that choice.\\n\\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\\n\\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\\n\\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\\naddress new problems or concerns.\", metadata={'source': 'determined/tools/scripts/licenses/throttle-debounce', 'url': 'https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/main/tools/scripts/licenses/throttle-debounce'}),\n",
